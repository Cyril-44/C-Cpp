<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>This program turns C/C++ source code files into functionally equivalent
C/C++ source code that is much more difficult to study, analyze
and modify - thus providing you control over intellectual property theft.
It works perfectly with multi-module programs and
for programs that depend on a lot of third-party modules that are not subject
to obfuscation.</P>
<P>This program typically obfuscates only one C/C++ source file at a time, reading source
code file from stdin and writing output to stdout. It's possble to request it
to save the output directly to a file using <STRONG>-o</STRONG> switch. There are special
aids to protect several files at once, this is done using <EM>multifile</EM>
``mode'' - see description of it in the documentation of the <STRONG>-S</STRONG> option below.</P>
<P>All comments are stripped away by default, but this can be switched off
by passing the <STRONG>--keep-comments</STRONG> switch. It's possible to add comments
with author and copyright information  to the top and to the end of the
obfuscated version of the file using options <STRONG>--bannerhead</STRONG> and
<STRONG>--bannertail</STRONG> respectively. Of course these comments
will appear in clear text form in the obfuscated file, independant of whether
encoding was applied to it.</P>
<P>The obfuscation typically means</P>
<UL>
<LI>
replacing all symbol names it's possible to with the
non-meaningfull ones, e.g. replacing variable <EM>files</EM> with <EM>zcadaa4fc81</EM>, while
preserving synaxical and semantical correctness of the source code. Of
course predefined symbols like <EM>document</EM> and 
symbols from the third-party or standard libraries the source code uses will 
be left
the same so the obfuscated code will still work without requiring to 
obfuscate those third-party  and standard libraries.
<P></P>
<LI>
substitution of numeric values with the arithmetic 
expressions using (random or constant for the same numeric value as requested
by the options) decimial and hexadecimial numeric values that evaluate to the 
same value
<P></P>
<LI>
using hexadecimial character codes for all characters in strings
<P></P>
<LI>
removing extra white space
<P></P>
<LI>
jamming as much code on each line (of length not more than specified
using <STRONG>--output-line-len</STRONG> option) as possible if <STRONG>--jam=0</STRONG> is not specified
<P></P></UL>
<P>The non-encoded obfuscated code is extremely difficult to understand for a human since
the name of variables and subroutines and other symbols are totally meaningless
and hard to remember (e.g. <EM>files</EM> becomes <EM>zcadaa4fc81</EM>). It's possible
to control most aspects of obfuscation using the commandline switches of the
CXX-Obfus.</P>
<P>It's possible to request CXX-Obfus to save the mapping between obfuscated
symbol names and original symbol names in the external file by passing
the filename after <STRONG>-d</STRONG> switch.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="options">OPTIONS</A></H1>
<P>It's possible to store the default commandline options in the globally-visible
file <EM>$instroot/lib/cxx-obfus/cxx-obfus-settings.pl</EM> (where <STRONG>$instroot</STRONG>
is a directory in which the CXX-Obfus package was installed to). See 
comments in that file for more information.</P>
<P>Note that there is interacive web-based commandline builder for CXX-Obfus 
available at <A HREF="http://www.stunnix.com/support/interactive/cmd-builder/">http://www.stunnix.com/support/interactive/cmd-builder/</A>.</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Dv%7C%2D%2Dversion"><STRONG>-v|--version</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Output version information and exit.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Doutput%2Dline%2Dlen_N"><STRONG>--output-line-len</STRONG> <EM>N</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Set the maximum line length for the obfuscated file. However, if some string
constant will be longer than this limit, it won't be split or otherwise 
wrapped, resulting in a line longer than an amount specified. The default
value for parameter <EM>N</EM> is <EM>80</EM>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Djam_0%7C1"><STRONG>--jam</STRONG> <EM>0</EM>|<EM>1</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Control whether to omit extra white spaces. When argument is <EM>1</EM>, all extra
white spaces (including carridge returns) are omitted, that makes the
obfuscated file looking even less readable. 
When argument is <EM>0</EM>, the obfuscated (but not encoded) file will look 
like original file with respect to spaces and newlines - in particular it will
have the same identation.
By default jamming is enabled (value is <EM>1</EM>).
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dcxx11%2Dinvalid%2Doutput"><STRONG>--cxx11-invalid-output</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Allow to produce more compact code, but that is invalid C++11 code. By default, valid C++11 
code  is produced.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dkeep%2Dspaces"><STRONG>--keep-spaces</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Request not to skip extra spaces in the lines (whitespaces and tabs) if 
jamming is  enabled (which is the default). By default 
extra spaces in the line are ignored if jamming is enabled.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dkeep%2Dnewlines"><STRONG>--keep-newlines</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Request not to skip newlines if jamming is  enabled (which is the default). 
By default newlines are ignored if jamming is enabled.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dkeep%2Dcomments"><STRONG>--keep-comments</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Requests to keep all comments. By default all comments are stripped away.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dtransform%2Dcomments_replace%2Dwith%2Dnewlin"><STRONG>--transform-comments</STRONG> <EM>replace-with-newlines</EM>|<EM>truncate</EM>|<EM>chars2x</EM>|<EM>nonwhites2x</EM>|<EM>keep-original</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If <STRONG>--keep-comments</STRONG> is specified on the commandline, this option
specifies what to do with comments.  By default comments are not modified
(this corresponds to value <EM>keep-original</EM> of this option). The possible
values for this option are:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_replace%2Dwith%2Dnewlines"><STRONG>replace-with-newlines</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If specified, comment delimiters and
their bodies are removed, and are replaced with newlines contained in the
comment bodies (thus keeping line numbers in sync with original code, but
not revealing locations where comments were located).
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_truncate"><STRONG>truncate</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If specified, only newlines are kept in bodies of comments.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_chars2x"><STRONG>chars2x</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If specified, newlines are kept in bodies of comments, and all other characters
including spaces are replaced with character 'x'.
This is useful to show that original code contained some comments, and
give an impression on what length of them was.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_nonwhites2x"><STRONG>nonwhites2x</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If specified, newlines are kept in bodies of comments, and all other characters
except whitespaces are replaced with character 'x', whitespaces are left as is.
This is useful to show that original code contained some comments, and
give an impression on what length of them was, and what content they had
approximately (since a lot of comments in the code happen to be various
separators formed by repeating some character like dash for entire length
of the line).
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_keep%2Doriginal"><STRONG>keep-original</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If specified, comments are kept as they were in original code. This is
a default value for this option.
<P></P></DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dpreserved%2Dtop%2Dcomments%2Dcount_0"><STRONG>--preserved-top-comments-count</STRONG> <EM>0</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Specifies how many topmost comments in each file to be  preserved in the output.
Often source files start with copyright notice, use this option to preserve it in output files.
The default value for this option is 0.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dbannerhead_filename"><STRONG>--bannerhead</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dbannertail_filename"><STRONG>--bannertail</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Specify the file whoose content will be prepended or appended to the
obfuscated file. This is most useful for adding comments with copyright
and license information. Such comments will be visible as clear text
in any file that was obfuscated and/or encoded.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Do_destination%2Dfilename"><STRONG>-o</STRONG> <EM>destination-filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Output the obfuscated version to the named file. 
There is no default value for this option - i.e. 
the obfuscated file is written to stdout by default.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dexcludeidentsfile_filename"><STRONG>--excludeidentsfile</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Dx_filename"><STRONG>-x</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This option can be specified more than once. It allows to specify the names of
files that contain a list of symbol names that won't be mangled, one symbol 
per line. 
Such symbols are called exceptions from this point. 
Comments are allowed in such files by placing a hash sign (<CODE>#</CODE>)
as the first character of the line. The file name specified is first searched
in the current directory (if it's not absolute path), and then in the
subdirectory <EM>lib/cxx-obfus/exceptions/</EM> of the directory where
CXX-Obfus was installed to.
There is no need to add names of C/C++ pre-defined variables and 
functions - they are already hardcoded into
<EM>CXX-Obfus</EM>. The default set of 
exceptions CXX-Obfus uses can be controlled in the file that stores
``persistent settings'' for it - located in the 
<EM>lib/cxx-obfus/cxx-obfus-settings.pl</EM> in the directory where 
CXX-Obfus was installed.
<P>It's possible to remove symbols from lists of exceptions by passing
names of files with these symbol names using <STRONG>-X</STRONG> switch.</P>
<P>The <EM>filename</EM> can be name of directory, in this case all files located
in this directory and any of its subdirectories (at any depth) are 
loaded as if the names of these files were specified individually one-by-one.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dexcludeidentsfile%2Danycase_filename"><STRONG>--excludeidentsfile-anycase</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This option is very similar to <STRONG>--excludeidentsfile</STRONG>, except that symbols
read from the specified file are treated as case-insensitive exceptions. 
This functionality is useful for listing methods and properties of ActiveX 
objects, that are case-insensitive.
<P>The <EM>filename</EM> can be name of directory, in this case all files located
in this directory and any of its subdirectories (at any depth) are 
loaded as if the names of these files were specified individually one-by-one.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2DX_filename"><STRONG>-X</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This option can be specified more than once. It allows to specify the names of
files that contain a list of symbol names that should be mangled, even
if those symbol names were in the files with names passed with <STRONG>-x</STRONG> switch
(i.e. for disabling some exceptions). At first files specified with <STRONG>-x</STRONG>
switch are processed, and then files specified with <STRONG>-X</STRONG>
switch are processed.
<P>Comments are allowed in such files by placing a hash sign (<CODE>#</CODE>)
as the first character of the line. The file name specified is first searched
in the current directory (if it's not absolute path), and then in the
subdirectory <EM>lib/cxx-obfus/exceptions/</EM> of the directory where
CXX-Obfus was installed to.</P>
<P>This option is mostly useful in case the set of exceptions created from
builtin list and content of files passed with <STRONG>-x</STRONG> switch is too 
broad.</P>
<P>The <EM>filename</EM> can be name of directory, in this case all files located
in this directory and any of its subdirectories (at any depth) are 
loaded as if the names of these files were specified individually one-by-one.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dquoted%2Dsymbol%2Dnames_filename"><STRONG>--quoted-symbol-names</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This option can be specified more than once. It allows to specify the names of
files that contain a list of symbol names that should be mangled, when found in strings.
The string will be replaced if it contains just symbol name, without any other characters 
in it. E.g. if the file contains the line <EM>bar</EM>, then the string <EM>``bar''</EM> will be
replaced with a string, containing replacement used for <EM>bar</EM>, e.g. <EM>``zb4da9ec5''</EM>;
while the strings <EM>``bar!''</EM> or <EM>``the bar near us''</EM> will not be altered 
as name <EM>bar</EM> is surrounded by other characters inside those strings.
<P>This can be seen alternative to using <EM>OBJNAME</EM> function. So instead of wrapping symbol
names in call of <EM>OBJNAME</EM>, you can just list those symbols in a file and pass name of
that file after <STRONG>--quoted-symbol-names</STRONG> switch.</P>
<P>Note that you can use this functionality to hide some hash keys you internally use in your code
for storing data in various structures or even config files. CXX-Obfus will also accept
<EM>-</EM> (dash) in names of symbols loaded from <EM>filename</EM>, to allow using keys with dashes.</P>
<P>Comments are allowed in such files by placing a hash sign (<CODE>#</CODE>)
as the first character of the line. The file name specified is first searched
in the current directory (if it's not absolute path), and then in the
subdirectory <EM>lib/cxx-obfus/exceptions/</EM> of the directory where
CXX-Obfus was installed to.</P>
<P>The <EM>filename</EM> can be name of directory, in this case all files located
in this directory and any of its subdirectories (at any depth) are 
loaded as if the names of these files were specified individually one-by-one.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dsuffixes%2Dasis%2Dlist_filename"><STRONG>--suffixes-asis-list</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This option can be specified more than once. It allows to specify the names of
files that contain a list of suffixes that should be preserved in
symbols being mangled. E.g. if suffix <EM>onclick</EM> is listed in some file
mentioned by this option, then symbol <EM>myButton_onclick</EM> will be
mangled to something like <EM>z2b9a0ec6d_onclick</EM>, rather than to
something like <EM>za40f93e635d</EM>.
<P>Comments are allowed in such files by placing a hash sign (<CODE>#</CODE>)
as the first character of the line. The file name specified is first searched
in the current directory (if it's not absolute path), and then in the
subdirectory <EM>lib/cxx-obfus/exceptions/</EM> of the directory where
CXX-Obfus was installed to.</P>
<P>This option is mostly useful for protecting code for environments, that scan
name of symbol for some suffix in order to treat the symbol specially.</P>
<P>The <EM>filename</EM> can be name of directory, in this case all files located
in this directory and any of its subdirectories (at any depth) are 
loaded as if the names of these files were specified individually one-by-one.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2DF_user%2Ddefined%2Dmapping%2Dfilename"><STRONG>-F</STRONG> <EM>user-defined-mapping-filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This option can be specified more than once. It allows to specify the names of
files that contain user-specified mapping of symbols.
<P>Comments are allowed in such files by placing a hash sign (<CODE>#</CODE>)
as the first character of the line. Each line in such file contains two 
symbols: name of original symbol, one or more space characters, and required 
resultant symbol.</P>
<P>In case some mangling engine decides to assign a symbol that is listed as
resultant symbol, special attempts will be made to guarantee that the symbol
chosen by obfuscation engine won't conflict with it (by adding prefixes
until unqueness is reached).</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Dd_map%2Dfilename"><STRONG>-d</STRONG> <EM>map-filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This option specifies the name of file to write the mapping between
obfuscated symbol names and non-obfuscated symbol names to.
Such mapping may be useful for analyzing C/C++ error messages that contain
obfuscated symbol names - just find the line with the symbol C/C++ interpreter
complained about, and the second word on that line will be the original
symbol name. Please keep in mind that it will be much easier for a 
person having access to such mapfile to study the code, so 
it's highly suggested to keep such map file in secure place and not
to distribute it to the customers.
<P>If the file specified with this option exists, the accumulated mapping
information will be <STRONG>merged</STRONG> with mapping information previously 
stored in the file - this allows one to have map file for entire project.</P>
<P>By default no filename is specified, and thus mapping information 
is not saved anywhere.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2D%2Dembed%2Dmap"><STRONG>--embed-map</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This option instructs the mapping between obfuscated symbol names and
original  symbol names to be appended inside a comment to the result of
processing, in form of couple of strings per line - obfuscated symbol name
 and original  symbol name. For symbols that are exceptions (i.e. for ones
obfuscated symbol name is the same as original) such lines are not emitted
at all. Lines are emitted only for symbols found in subject file.
<P>By default this mapping information is not embedded at all.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2DD_list%2Dof%2Dsymbols%2Dfilename"><STRONG>-D</STRONG> <EM>list-of-symbols-filename</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Instructs CXX-Obfus to save a list of symbols encountered during
processing to the <EM>list-of-symbols-filename</EM>. The file will be overwritten.
This is useful e.g. when generating a list of exceptions from some library, 
since the resultant file can be used for passing to <STRONG>-x</STRONG> or <STRONG>-X</STRONG>
switches while processing files that use that library.
<P>.</P>

Specify options for mangling of tokens of each type.
The argument is <EM>mangling-specification</EM>, that has the following syntax:
<P><EM>obfuscator-title</EM>[,<EM>option</EM>=<EM>value</EM>]..</P>
<P>Tokens of each type can be mangled using different approaches, each approach
corresponds to <EM>obfuscator</EM>, identified by <EM>obfuscator-title</EM>. Each
<EM>obfuscator</EM> can have options that alter its behaviour, in order to specify
them the comma separated
<EM>option</EM>=<EM>value</EM> pairs may follow <EM>obfuscator-title</EM> after a comma.</P>
<P>The <EM>mangling-specification</EM> specifies all details on how to mangle tokens
of each type, so if multiplie occurences of the option are specified, the last
one is taken into the effect.</P>
<P>For each type of token a special obfuscator with title <EM>none</EM> is available - 
it doesn't alter the tokens in any way.</P>
<P>Here is a list of <EM>obfuscators</EM> for each type of the token, with the options
they support.</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Di_%3D_obfuscators_for_symbol_names"><STRONG>-i</STRONG> = obfuscators for symbol names</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
It's obvious that symbols with the same name should be 
obfuscated  to the same name, independant of location in the program
these symbol names are locatged. It also should be obvious that entire set of modules 
and scripts that uses them should be obfuscated using the same value of
<EM>mangling-specification</EM> - otherwise there will appear undeclared symbols.
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_obfuscator_none">obfuscator <STRONG>none</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Selecting this obfuscator will keep symbol names unchanged.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_obfuscator_combs">obfuscator <STRONG>combs</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This obfuscator replaces names of symbols with names consisting of all
possible combinations of characters, specified via option <EM>spec</EM>,
of the length specified via option <EM>minlen</EM>. E.g. it 
can replace <EM>formname</EM> with <EM>IlI</EM> and <EM>mystr</EM> with <EM>llI</EM> 
(which both look very similar to the  human eye) if user specified
the value of <EM>spec</EM> option as <EM>Il</EM>.
<P>The replacement symbol depends solely on the index of symbol being seen for the first time
in the project, and on the value of <EM>seed</EM> argument.</P>
<P>The detection of collisions for symbols in the current file is done 
automatically. It's possible to activate detection of collisions for symbols 
in entire project by the use of <EM>adhere-mapfile</EM> option of this symbol
obfuscator.</P>
<P>If option <EM>adhere-mapping</EM> is specified for this obfuscator and has non-zero
value and if mapfile name is specified via global option <EM>-d</EM>, then 
CXX-Obfus will read specified mapfile at startup, and will 
try to lookup the original symbol names in it and use a replacement from that
file if found; it will also ensure that protected symbols that were produced
during that invokation of CXX-Obfus are not assigned to any symbol 
listed in mapfile (and if it encounters some obfuscated symbol it was going 
to use as a replacement as being used as a replacement for another symbol
(i.e. so-called ``hash-collision'' occurs) then execution of CXX-Obfus
is aborted with error message - in which case it's necessary to
clear mapfile, change the seed and/or increase value of <EM>len</EM> option
and protect entire application again); after processing completes, mapfile will
be updated as usual.</P>
<P>Note, that <EM>shortest</EM> symbol obfuscator also can generate protected symbols 
using all possible combinations of characters, but it allows to generate

<DD>
This obfuscator replaces all symbols with one of names you specify, but randomly
altering case of letters in the names. E.g. if you specify <EM>spec</EM> option as
<EM>strictly_confidential</EM> it will replace names of symbols with
<EM>sTrictly_CONfidENTiAl</EM>, <EM>StRiCtly_cOnFiDeNTiaL</EM>, <EM>stRIctLY_coNFiDeNTiaL</EM>
and other possible variantions. You can specify several replacement names
via <EM>spec</EM> option, separating them with <EM>:</EM> (colon).
The replacement symbol depends solely on the index of symbol being seen for the first time
in the project, and on the value of <EM>seed</EM> argument.
<P>The detection of collisions for symbols in the current file is done 
automatically. It's possible to activate detection of collisions for symbols 
in entire project by the use of <EM>adhere-mapfile</EM> option of this symbol
obfuscator.</P>
<P>If option <EM>adhere-mapping</EM> is specified for this obfuscator and has non-zero
value and if mapfile name is specified via global option <EM>-d</EM>, then 
CXX-Obfus will read specified mapfile at startup, and will 
try to lookup the original symbol names in it and use a replacement from that
file if found; it will also ensure that protected symbols that were produced
during that invokation of CXX-Obfus are not assigned to any symbol 
listed in mapfile (and if it encounters some obfuscated symbol it was going 
to use as a replacement as being used as a replacement for another symbol
(i.e. so-called ``hash-collision'' occurs) then execution of CXX-Obfus
is aborted with error message - in which case it's necessary to
clear mapfile,  and change the seed and/or use longer names in <EM>spec</EM> argument,

<DD>
This obfuscator calculates md5 sum of the string produced by concatentation
of a constant prefix (that can be passed via <STRONG>seed</STRONG> option) and the symbol 
name to be obfuscated. After that from the hexadecimial representation of the
md5sum several (exact length is specified using <STRONG>len</STRONG> option)
leading characters are appended to another prefix
(that can be set via <STRONG>prefix</STRONG> option) to form obfuscated symbol name.
<P>It's obvious that in theory it's possible to get md5sum collision - the 
critical situation when two different symbols will be obfuscated to the same 
symbol name. When such situation is detected, the obfuscation is aborted.
The detection of collisions for symbols in the current file is done 
automatically. If detection of collisions for symbols in entire project
is required, one can use <EM>adhere-mapfile</EM> option for enforcing uniqueness
of protected symbols across all files - please read the description of
symbol name obfuscator <EM>combs</EM>.
The only solution in case md5sum collision is detected is to change the value 
of the <STRONG>seed</STRONG> option or to increase

This obfuscator just prepends the same string (specified via <STRONG>str</STRONG> option)
to all symbol names to get the obfuscated symbol name. This obfuscator is
designed to be used for initial testing of obfuscated code for locations of
use of undeclared symbols in obfuscated code. It's obvious that 
while testing obfuscated code it's much more easier  to find out what symbol 
is undeclared if it's trivial to correlate that symbol of the obfuscated
program with the symbol of the non-obfuscated program.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_obfuscator_shortest">obfuscator <STRONG>shortest</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This obfuscator replaces each symbol name with the shortest identifier
possible, using the shorter identifiers for symbols that are used more
frequently. Using this obfuscator and <EM>none</EM> obfuscators for strings and
numbers will produce the most compact version of the code possible. 
The presence of this obfuscator turns CXX-Obfus into so-called source code <EM>``compressor''</EM>.
<P>It's perfectly suitable for multimodule projects too.
There are two modes of operation this obfuscator works in 
(controlled by its parameter <STRONG>countupdate</STRONG>) - scanning through the project 
files for computing the use counts for all symbols (used if 
parameter <STRONG>countupdate</STRONG> is passed value <EM>1</EM>) and saving the
counts to a special file hereafter called <EM>countsfile</EM> 
(whose name is specified as value of 
parameter <STRONG>countsfile</STRONG>) or performing the obfuscation
itself using the symbol use counts from <EM>countsfile</EM> gathered during 
first mode of operation
(used if parameter <STRONG>countupdate</STRONG> is passed value <EM>0</EM>, or if
this parameter is not specified at all). In the obfuscation mode
obfuscator maintains its state (a mapping between original symbols and
obfuscated ones) in the file whose name specified as a value of
parameter <STRONG>statefile</STRONG> (hereafter such file will be called <EM>statefile</EM>).</P>
<P>Note that file with symbol counts should be up to date
- at least it should mention all symbols that are subject to obfuscation - 
so if you added some code and introduced some new symbols, you'll have to 
regenerate <EM>countsfile</EM>. CXX-Obfus aborts execution if it 
encounters that some symbol was not counted at all, with diagnostics indicating
that <EM>countsfile</EM> needs to be rebuilt. Rebuilding <EM>countsfile</EM> means
deleting (or truncating) the <EM>countsfile</EM> and <EM>statefile</EM> and running 
CXX-Obfus in symbol count gathering mode on all files of the project.
If your change to the code didn't introduce new symbols but just
increased or decreased the use of already existing ones, it won't abort
the execution but there will be a chance that size of resultant obfuscated
file won't be the smallest possible.</P>
<P>So the common approach to using this obfuscator for symbol names is:
develop and debug the code, delete files <EM>a-file-with-counts</EM> and
<EM>a-file-with-state</EM>, then run the CXX-Obfus with options
like this  <CODE>-i shortest,countupdate=1,countsfile=a-file-with-counts</CODE> for all
source files in the project to gather symbol counts to the file
<EM>a-file-with-counts</EM>, and then run CXX-Obfus with options
like this  
<CODE>-i shortest,countupdate=0,countsfile=a-file-with-counts,statefile=a-file-with-state</CODE>
for all source files in the project.</P>
<P>Another option is to process all files in your project in one invokation of  CXX-Obfus,
and use <EM>twopasses=1</EM> option of this mangler. In that case, you won't need to 
pass <EM>..,countsfile=a-file-with-counts,statefile=a-file-with-state</EM> options to the mangler - 
it will maintain counts file and state file in temporary files.</P>
<P>By default each symbol name is obfuscated to the unique, but random identifier
of the length corresponding to the number of occurencies of the
given symbol. That randomness of identifier can be disabled by passing
value <EM>0</EM> for parameter <STRONG>dontshuffle</STRONG> - this will force e.g. first symbol in 
the first source file of the project to always be obfuscated to the name
<EM>a</EM>
(provided there is no exception with the same name).</P>
<P>It's possible to specify a set of characters that can be used for resultant
symbol names by the use of <EM>spec</EM> option - e.g. one can make code very hard
to analyze without modification by asking to use only symbols <EM>I</EM> and <EM>l</EM>
for names of symbols - that will produce symbols like <EM>IllII</EM> or <EM>IIlIIl</EM>
which look very similar in the most fonts (but of course this won't result
in smallest output). 
The use of this option makes <EM>shortest</EM> obfuscator a reliable version
of <EM>combs</EM> obfuscator for multi-module projects, since it eliminates
a chance for a case when two different symbols in two different modules
(in which only one of the symbols is used) getting replaced with the same
resultant symbol (which is possible in theory, but has a very small 
possibility).</P>

So it obviates the need to call  CXX-Obfus manually two times. 
It will protect your entire project in one invokation of  CXX-Obfus.

arguments of CXX-Obfus or via <STRONG>filelist</STRONG> parameter; 
they may be located in different directories.
The name of the output directory is specified with <EM>outdir</EM> option of
this server mode; if filenames to process are absolute pathnames it's necessary

If filenames to process are relative names, it's assumed that current directory
is input directory relative to which output filenames will be computed.
All necessary output subdirectories will automatically be created.
<P>Example:</P>
<P>The following commandline fragments:</P>

<P>are equivalent if current directory is <EM>/home/user/prj1/in</EM>. So at first
 CXX-Obfus will create <EM>/home/user/prj1/out/subdir1</EM> (if absent),

<P>The following commandline obfuscates and encodes file <EM>blah..cpp</EM> using default 
parameters and exceptions from file named <EM>./excepts</EM>, 
writing obfuscated and encoded version to <EM>oblah..cpp</EM>:</P>
<PRE>
    cxx-obfus blah..cpp -o oblah..cpp -x ./excepts</PRE>
<P>The following commandline is recommended way of obfuscating file 
<EM>blah..cpp</EM> for shipping using default parameters and exceptions from file 
named <EM>./excepts</EM>, writing obfuscated and encoded version to <EM>oblah..cpp</EM> (the main
difference from previous example is passing the value of the <STRONG>seed</STRONG> 
parameter for obfuscator routine for symbol names):</P>
<PRE>
    cxx-obfus blah..cpp -o oblah..cpp -x ./excepts -i md5,seed=SomeRandomString</PRE>
<P>The following commandline is a recommended for producing the mildly-obfuscated
non-encoded version of the  <EM>blah..cpp</EM> that is ideal for testing whether the obfuscated
code  has no problems like use of undefined symbols (that may arise due to
insufficiently complete list of exceptions in file <EM>./excepts</EM>) :</P>
<PRE>
    cxx-obfus blah..cpp -e 0 -o oblah..cpp -x ./excepts -n none -s none -i prefix,str=ZZZ</PRE>
<P>The following commandlines are a sample of passing same set values for all options
to the <STRONG>md5</STRONG> obfuscator routine for symbol names. It obfuscates and encodes
file <EM>blah..cpp</EM>, writing obfuscated and encoded version of the file to <EM>oblah..cpp</EM>:</P>
<PRE>
    cxx-obfus blah..cpp -o oblah..cpp -i md5,seed=57823,prefix=p,len=5
    cxx-obfus blah..cpp -o oblah..cpp -i 'md5,prefix=p, seed=57823 , len=5'</PRE>
<P>The following example obfuscates and encodes file <EM>blah..cpp</EM>, 
writing obfuscated and encoded version of the file to <EM>oblah..cpp</EM>,
with embedding code for license checking that allows the code to be executed
itself till 28 April 2005; upon expiration
of the code default message is printed:</P>
<PRE>
    cxx-obfus blah..cpp -o oblah..cpp 
        -T 'expire,whenexpires=28 April 2005,onviolated-warn=1'

<P>It's possible to store the default commandline options in the globally-visible
file <EM>$instroot/lib/cxx-obfus/cxx-obfus-settings.pl</EM> (where <STRONG>$instroot</STRONG>
is a directory in which the CXX-Obfus package was installed to) 
which is a Perl module. 
This file defines one sub <EM>cmnargs</EM> that should return a list of
options to  be prepended to actual commandline the cxx-obfus, thus allowing to store
``persistent settings'' for cxx-obfus.</P>

<P>In most cases, once properly prepared for obfuscation, obfuscated version 
of the code should work the same as non-obfuscated. 
After fixing the issues with incomplete
set of exceptions, it's recommended to check whether ofbuscated code behaves
exactly the same as original - by using pre-existing testsuite or 
checking functionality manually.</P>
<P>If some obfuscated code is syntaxically correct but works differently
than original version , 
obfuscate it without encoding and string, integer and ident mangling 
as following:</P>
<P>Then try to run it again. If it still does not work correctly, find the source 
file which is guilty by replacing each of the obfuscated files with original
ones one by one. After you have found the file that contains the problem, 
append the definitions of all functions from the source file to that target
file and by temporary renaming function names in the appended part 
to something else (e.g. by suffixing 
the names with '1' or 'blah') you will
be able to find the function that is guilty. Same process can be applied to
the blocks in the guilty function too (just replace obfuscated parts with
source parts) to find out which part of the obfuscate function is misbehaving.</P>
<P>Having found the function block that misbehaves, that block should be
modified in order the obfuscated version to have the same functionality
as original code.</P>
