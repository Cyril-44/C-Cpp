This directory is prepended to the Include Path List - so even a module with
same name is installed in the $perlroot/site_perl directory, the one
from this directory will be used.

Text/Forge.pm contains an embedded version of Text::Forge 2.16, that doesn't
have dependcies except on File::Spec (and it can be removed easily too).
